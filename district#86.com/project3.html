<div class="intro">
  Collage art has been a long-established form of art. 
  It’s a versatile medium that’s unrestrained by conventional 
  forms of artistic expression and can be used to document time, 
  history, and change. Beijing-based artist He Chong is one of 
  the few Chinese artists who work primarily in this medium. 
  But aside from his collage art, He Chong is also an avid 
  photographer whose weapons of choice are Lomography cameras. 
  In a way, his style in both mediums is quite similar, psychedelic 
  and surreal but presented in a unique retro aesthetic.

  When talking about the current state of collage art in China, 
  He Chong tells us: “Most of the collage works that people know 
  of are made by foreign artists. In China, there are only a few 
  artists that work in this medium, and most of them are art students 
  who might learn about or use collage for a class assignment. 
  But I feel that in both the fields of art and design, collage 
  is a medium that has impressive visual potential. I believe it 
  has a bright future.”

  As a self-described reclusive artist, He Chong spends his free time 
  with his wife creating collages, taking photographs, or walking in 
  the park. He’s someone who has found happiness in living a laid-back 
  lifestyle rather than chasing superficial pursuits. He Chong’s work 
  is much like his attitude towards life, relaxed and unconstrained. 
  The creative freedom of collage art seems to perfectly go hand in hand 
  with the mellow, carefree attitude that He Chong <br>lives by.
