<div class="intro">
  “Henri Chinaski’s Short Stories” by
   Nathan Zhou presents the artist’s most recent 
   and site-specic works. Nathan Zhou adopts the 
   methodology of novel writing and applies to art 
   making and graffiti improvisation.
  <br><br>
  Nathan Zhou was born in in Dongguan, Guangzhou. 
  He graduated from Guizhou University in English 
  Language and Literature in 2004. He currently works
  and lives in Shanghai. The artist is proficient at
  depicting individual world, where the reality and 
  illusion interweave, by virtue of intuitive and 
  brimming painting language. Using graffiti and collage
  as primary technique infuses his works with the strong 
  look of a personal diary. Deciduous topics, image, 
  chronicle and the artist’s unique language are united 
  as a method, creating fulfilling and inspiring tension, 
  that, analogous to repeated syncopation in Jazz music, 
  echoes in different works by the artist.
  <br><br>
  As a “novelist”, Nathan Zhou adopts the methodology
  of novel writing and applies to art making and graffiti
  improvisation. He categorizes his observation and 
  thoughts about his own daily life into various aspects
  and accomplished these “short stories” in the style of
  stream of consciousness.
